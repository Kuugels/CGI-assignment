# CGI-assignment
Testing phase assignment

Overall I used about 10-11 hours on this assignment.

Before I started making this assignment I used few hours just practising the use of node.js and MongoDB as I had never used them before. And overall I used about 10-11 hours on this assignment. 

At first I started this assignment by using 2-3 hours just to set up basic server and to make a simple index page. After I got the server working I started making code to retrive images using Imgur's API and it took maybe 1-2 hours. 

After that I spend around 2 hours to set up the MongoDb and to make the code for saving Image metadata to it. When I got that working, I started to work on making search API. Making it proved to be a bit challenging because I had not made RESTful API's before. So in the end making it took around 2-3 hours.
